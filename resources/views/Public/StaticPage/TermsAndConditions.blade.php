      <div>
        <div><b>1.&nbsp;</b><b>Listings</b></div>
        <div>You can use the Ticketana platform to promote your event.<br></div>
        <div><br></div>
        <div>You must only list events that are genuine. You must not deceive (or attempt to deceive) consumers by displaying false, inaccurate or misleading information. Similarly, the event itself must meet all applicable laws, rules and regulations and must otherwise comply with these terms.</div>
        <div><br></div>
        <div>By posting a listing on the platform, you warrant that (i) you are duly authorized to promote the relevant event, (ii) you are not infringing any intellectual property, or other rights, and (iii) you are acting legally and in accordance with all applicable laws. <b>You will pay us for any loss we suffer because of any of these warranties being incorrect</b>.&nbsp;<br></div>
      <div><br></div>
      <div>If an event is inappropriate for younger attendees, you must ensure that your listing includes an appropriate age description.&nbsp;<br></div>
      <div><br></div>
      <div>We aren’t obliged to review listings, but we may. We can decline or remove a listing, in our discretion, including where:<br></div>
      <div>•<span class="sty__cls">	</span>It appears to relate to an illegitimate purpose</div>
      <div>•<span class="sty__cls">	</span>An organiser has provided insufficient information&nbsp;</div>
      <div><br></div>
      </div>
      <div><br></div>
      <div><b>2. O</b><b>ur Role</b></div>
      <div><b>By selling tickets for an event, you are contracting with the consumer and not with Ticketana.</b><br></div>
      <div><br></div>
      <div>We act as your limited payment agent, to collect payments from consumers for your event, and to pass these payments to you (or the relevant beneficiary).&nbsp;<br></div>
      <div><br></div>
      <div>You authorise us to (i) collect, hold, disburse and retain proceeds on your behalf; (ii) where we determine a consumer is entitled to a refund, to issue the refund. <b>In accepting the appointment as your limited agent, we assume no liability for any act or omission on your part.</b><br></div>
      <div><br></div>
      <div><b>3.&nbsp;</b><b>What we Charge</b></div>
      <div>Creating an account, listing an event and accessing the platform are free. However, we charge fees when we process payments on your behalf. These fees may vary based on individual agreements between organisers and Ticketana.&nbsp;<span>Our fees typically comprise a percentage based fee ("Commission") and a fixed fee per item ("Booking Fee").&nbsp;</span><span>Organisers ultimately determine whether these fees will be charged to consumers and shown as fees on the applicable booking page or absorbed into the ticket price and paid by the organiser out of gross proceeds.&nbsp;</span></div>
      <div><br></div>
      <div>Our fees may change from time to time, and may vary based on several factors including but not limited to product type, price, country, payment method, and currency. Our fees can be viewed on the Ticketana website under the relevant product section.<br></div>
      <div><br></div>
      <div><span><b>Our Booking Fee is always non-refundable (even if a consumer receives a refund).&nbsp;</b></span><br></div>
      <div><br></div>
      <div><b>4. P</b><b>ayments</b></div>
      <div>Your Ticketana account displays the balance of amounts collected on your behalf. This balance represents only a general unsecured claim against Ticketana and not a store of value or a deposit/current account.<br></div>
      <div><br></div>
      <div>While we don’t make any promises, we will try our best to pay out the amounts collected on your behalf:</div>
      <div>•<span class="sty__cls">	</span>In the case of events, 3 business days after the end of the event<br></div>
      <div><br></div>
      <div>We don’t have to pay you until we have received payment in full from a consumer.<br></div>
      <div><br></div>
      <div>Where transaction proceeds are collected from a third party ticket vendor, we may withhold payment of funds to you until the vendor has settled any amounts owing to us.&nbsp;<br></div>
      <div><br></div>
      <div>If you or your third party payment provider collects proceeds from consumers directly, you must pay us our fee within 3 business days of the end of the event.<br></div>
      <div><br></div>
      <div><b>8.&nbsp;</b><b>Disclaimer, and Assumption of Risks by You</b></div>
      <div><b>You are solely responsible for delivering the event.</b><br></div>
      <div><br></div>
      <div>A payment processed by us on your behalf is considered the same as a payment made by a consumer directly to you. <b>You have the same responsibility to deliver the goods/services that you have listed on the platform as if you had received payment from the consumer directly (regardless of whether the funds have yet to be or are ever received from Ticketana).</b>&nbsp;<br></div>
      <div><br></div>
      <div>We will always request consumers to deal with organisers directly. <b>If you do not adequately deal with a consumer complaint, and the consumer continues to approach us for relief, we will take legal advice, and will take whatever action we believe is reasonable to resolve the complaint.</b> We take consumer protection very seriously, and you must respect this.&nbsp;</div>
      <div><br></div>
      <div><b>You will pay us for any loss we suffer because you failed to comply with your responsibilities to a consumer, or otherwise failed to adequately deal with a consumer complaint.</b><br></div>
      <div><br></div>
      <div><b>For physical events, you are solely responsible for the health and safety of all employees, service providers, ticket holders, suppliers, performers, vendors and other attendees. You must not organise or host an event unless you have appropriate insurance, including public liability insurance.</b> If any injury, damage or loss is suffered by any person at your event, we may require you to issue a public statement confirming that Ticketana is not affiliated with your event.&nbsp;</div>
      <div><br></div>
      <div>It is important that consumers get the best possible event experience. Curtailing that experience reflects poorly on the organiser, but also on Ticketana. An event will be considered “curtailed” in any of the following circumstances:<br></div>
      <div>•<span class="sty__5qgld2__cls">	</span>If an event starts more than half an hour outside of the listed time&nbsp;</div>
      <div>•<span class="sty__7otq45__cls">	</span>If any of the performers, speakers, or other key individuals are not present during the event</div>
      <div><br></div>
      <div>Where an event is curtailed, we reserve the right (in our discretion) to:</div>
      <div>•<span class="sty__jc88at__cls">	</span>Send out an SMS to ticket holders notifying them of the curtailment, the cost of which will be for the organiser’s account</div>
      <div>•<span class="sty__rcronh__cls">	</span>Display notice of the curtailment on the platform</div>
      <div>•<span class="sty__31080e__cls">	</span>Offer a refund to ticket holders on your behalf</div>
      <div><br></div>
      <div><b>You must pay us for any loss suffered by us, including reputational loss, as a result of any act or omission on your behalf.</b><br></div>
      <div><br></div>
      <div><b>Ticketana will not be liable for any indirect, special or consequential losses of any kind whatsoever arising from, or in connection with your use of the platform or our services.</b> “<b>Force Majeure</b>” means, in relation to Ticketana, any circumstances beyond the reasonable control of Ticketana including (without limitation) any acts of war or public enemy, civil commotion or strife, political or civil disturbance, riot, insurrection, strikes, lock-out, interruption of transport, labour dispute, boycott, fire, explosion, flood, storm, infectious or contagious disease, epidemic, pandemic or natural or physical disaster, sabotage, terrorism, acts or omissions of any government, government agency, provincial or local or similar authority, laws or regulations or any acts of God or forces of nature. Ticketana shall not be liable a result of any delays or failures of performance of its obligations if and to the extent that such delay or failure is caused by a Force Majeure event.</div>
